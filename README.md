# Endos - a python endoscope viewer

So I purchased a cheap endoscope online for lookiong down the back of furniture and when it arrived it reported only Windows functionality. This seemed a bit dull so I plugged it into my mac via USB-C and wrote this app to actually use the thing. Alternatives may exist was just for the sake of it too.

Features: Freeze image, take pic, record movie, rudimentary brightness controls.

For running from source, it was developed with Python 3.11 and you'll need a venv set up and the contents of requirements.txt installed. It's based on PyQt6 and OpenCV.

This is a BSD license so use it as you like.
